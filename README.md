Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous in machine learning, but their energy consumption remains a notable issue. Lowering the supply voltage is an effective strategy for reducing energy consumption. However, aggressively scaling down the supply voltage can lead to accuracy degradation due to random bit flips in static random access memory (SRAM) where model parameters are stored. To address this challenge, we introduce NeuralFuse, a novel add-on module that addresses the accuracy-energy tradeoff in low-voltage regimes by learning input transformations to generate error-resistant data representations. NeuralFuse protects DNN accuracy in both nominal and low-voltage scenarios. Moreover, NeuralFuse is easy to implement and can be readily applied to DNNs with limited access, such as non-configurable hardware or remote access to cloud-based APIs. Experimental results demonstrate that, at a 1% bit error rate, NeuralFuse can reduce SRAM memory access energy by up to 24% while improving accuracy by up to 57%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-agnostic approach (i.e., no model retraining) to address low-voltage-induced bit errors.

## Usage

## Run Base Model Training with QAT:
```python
python zs_main.py [resnet18 | resnet50 | vgg11 | vgg16 | vgg19] train [cifar10 | gtsrb | cifar100 | imagenet224] -E 300 -LR 0.001 -BS 256 
```

## Run NerualFuse Training:
```python
python zs_main.py [resnet18 | resnet50 | vgg11 | vgg16 | vgg19] transform_eopm_gen [cifar10 | gtsrb | cifar100 | imagenet224] -ber 0.01 -cp [please input the model path here] -E 300 -LR 0.001 -BS 256 -LM 5 -N 10 -G [ConvL | ConvS | DeConvL | DeConvS | UNetL | UNetS]
```

## Run NerualFuse Evaluation with Perturbed Base Model: 
Please set the setting in config.py first. 

For example, in config.py:

```python
'''
cfg.testing_mode: Choosing the evaluation mode.
    1. clean: Evaluate the clean accuracy of specific base model. 
    2. generator_base: Evalueate the improved accuracy by NeuralFuse on specific perturbed base model.
cfg.G_PATH: The path of the NeuralFuse model.
'''
cfg.testing_mode = 'generator_base' # clean / generator_base
cfg.G_PATH = ''  # Only work in generator_base mode.
```

```python
python zs_main.py [resnet18 | resnet50 | vgg11 | vgg16 | vgg19] transform_eval [cifar10 | gtsrb | cifar100 | imagenet224] -ber 0.01 -cp [please input the model path here] -BS 256 -TBS 256 -G [ConvL | ConvS | DeConvL | DeConvS | UNetL | UNetS]
```

## Arguments:
TBA.

## Choose Dataset:
* cifar10、cifar100、gtsrb、imagenet10

## Notes:
We also adopt the Pytorch offical architecture settings for all of the base models. To use the version of Pytorch offical implementation, please change the args into [resnet18Py | resnet50Py | vgg11Py | vgg16Py | vgg19Py] instead.
